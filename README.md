WebLibre is an independent browser project built on the foundation of [Mozilla's Gecko Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(software)) and [Mozilla Android Components](https://mozac.org/).

> **⚠️ Alpha Release Notice**  
> WebLibre is currently in alpha phase. Expect frequent updates, potential bugs, and breaking changes. Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/FaFre/WebLibre/issues).

## Features

### Privacy & Security

- **Local Data Storage:** All your data stays on your device.
- **Tor integration:** Route container or private tab traffic through the Tor network for greater anonymity.
- **uBlock Origin integration:** Optional content blocker during onboarding
- **Web Engine Hardening**: Comprehensive and easy to use presets. `about:config` access is available for expert users.
