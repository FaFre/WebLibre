<b>Privacy-Focused Browser with Local AI Assistance</b>

WebLibre is an independent privacy-focused browser for Android built on Mozilla's Gecko Engine and Mozilla Android Components. It offers a fully-featured web browser with extension support, enhanced by powerful privacy features, local AI assistance (opt-in), and advanced tab organization tools.

<b>Privacy by Design</b>

WebLibre shields you from third-party surveillance—whether by ISPs, tracking companies, or other entities seeking to monitor your browsing habits:

- <b>Web Engine Hardening</b>: Comprehensive privacy and security presets to resist tracking and fingerprinting
- <b>Cookie Isolation</b>: Cookies separated by container or context, preventing cross-site tracking
- <b>Content Blocking</b>: Blocks ads, trackers, and unwanted content by default
- <b>Tor Proxying</b>: Route browsing traffic through the Tor network for enhanced anonymity
- <b>Local Search Engine</b>: Your device handles search and retrieval, minimizing remote service contact
- <b>No Tracking or Telemetry</b>: WebLibre does not track, monitor, or collect any browsing data

<b>Advanced Tab Management</b>

- <b>Tab Containers</b>: Organize tabs into isolated containers with separate cookie contexts, Tor proxy support, biometric authentication, and automatic site assignments
- <b>Tree View Navigation</b>: Visualize and manage complex tab hierarchies with parent-child relationships
- <b>Local AI Assistance</b>: Use on-device AI models to intelligently group related tabs into new containers
- <b>Flexible Views</b>: Choose between list view, grid view, or tree view with tab hierarchy

<b>Personal Local Search Engine</b>

Instantly search across open tabs (with full page content), bookmarks, web feeds, browsing history, and bangs. All indexing and search operations happen on your device—your data never leaves your control.

<b>Multi-User Profiles</b>

Complete profile isolation with separate browsing data, extensions, settings, and databases per user. Each profile maintains its own containers, add-ons, privacy settings, and preferences.

<b>Download WebLibre and browse freely and privately with genuine control over your online experience.</b>
